# Nebulous Conquest Helper

This is a tool to store information about the Nebulous Community Conquest, a tabletop-esque grand strategy campaign with players split into two teams and given a solar system to fight over. The Unity-based game Nebulous: Fleet Command (available on Steam early access) is used to resolve individual battles within the larger campaign.

This tool provides a way for the players to access game info, and allows GMs to submit orders and advance turns. Information is stored in XML files, some of which correspond to in-game fleets and ship designs and can be seamlessly imported into the game. The primary method of interaction with this tool is intended to be through a Discord bot.

Accompanying the Helper is a Nebulous game modification (called SaveFleetState) that allows players to download post-game information which they can then submit as battle results for the Helper to store and process.
